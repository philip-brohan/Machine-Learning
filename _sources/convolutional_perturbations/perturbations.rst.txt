Perturbing the convolutional autoencoder
========================================

So we have :doc:`a convolutional autoencoder that works pretty well <../convolutional_autoencoder/autoencoder>`. Can we make it work even better - either improve the reconstruction accuracy or shrink the encoded state?

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   All-convolutional version <all_convolutional/autoencoder>

The all-convolutional architecture is clearly an improvement. So I'm using that as the basis for further perturbations:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   More layers (5, rather than 3) <more_layers_5/autoencoder>
