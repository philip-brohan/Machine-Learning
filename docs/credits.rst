* This document was written by Philip Brohan (Met Office). He was funded by the Joint BEIS and Defra Integrated Climate Programme, DECC/Defra (GA01101), and by the `Climate Science for Service Partnership China <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/collaboration/newton/cssp-china/index>`_.
  
* This work follows on from `a previous project on weather forecasts with machine learning <https://github.com/philip-brohan/weather2weather>`_, and `a previous project on `Improving reanalysis with offline assimilation <http://brohan.org/offline_assimilation/>`_.
 
* The `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ library is used throughout.
  
* The `20th Century Reanalysis <https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/20thC_Rean/>`_ dataset (version 2c) provides the training data used.
  
* `Vikram Tiwari's tf.keras Autoencoder page <https://www.kaggle.com/vikramtiwari/autoencoders-using-tf-keras-mnist>`_ was an invaluable introduction to both autoencoders and Tensorflow.
    
* Ashley Jager's `weather icons <https://www.npmjs.com/package/weather-underground-icons>`_ are used in the logo image.
