Getting started - a minimal autoencoder
=======================================

I like the idea of `autoencoders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder>`_ - part of the difficulty of working with 20CR is that there is so *much* of it, an automatic system for reducing it to a more manageable size is very appealing. So I looked for a very simple TensorFlow autoencoder example, and chose the first one from `Vikram Tiwari's tf.keras Autoencoder page <https://www.kaggle.com/vikramtiwari/autoencoders-using-tf-keras-mnist>`_.
